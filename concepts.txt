  DOM stands for document object model.
  as it models the entire html document in an object and thus to access those properties we use method like document.querySelector or etc..

  Virtual dom is replica/copy of existing dom, It can be updated without affecting original dom.
  Any changes is being done anywhere in the dom, it is compared to find a defference thus only those parts of the application are rerendered, instead of re render the entire dom.

  both Virtual DOM and Shadow DOM improve performance for further manipulation processes.

  shadow dom
  It revolves around the concept of encapsulation.the shadow DOM is a browser technology whose main objective is to provide encapsulation when creating elements
  In the Shadow DOM, all the elements are connected to the Shadow Root and Shadow HOST.
  It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
 

  Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.


  package-lock.json vs package.json
  package.json is a versioning file used to install multiple packages in your project.
  a package.json file contains metadata about the project and also the functional dependencies that is required by the application.
  for creating package.json -  npm init -y

  package-lock.json
  package.lock.json is created for locking the dependency with the installed version. It will install the exact latest version of that package in your application and save it in package.json.
   Letâ€™s say if the current version of the package is 1.3.2 then it will save the version with (^) sign. Here carot(^) means, it will support any higher version with major version 1 for eg. 1.2.2.


  framework is a collection of libraries , it supposts the mvc(model view controller) pattern.

  Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process.
      Good code quality, reusability, and control, enhanced speed and performance of the program, etc.
